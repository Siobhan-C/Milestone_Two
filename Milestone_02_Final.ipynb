        "            * learning_rate: This parameter controls how much each tree contributes to the final prediction. We experimented with values (0.01, 0.05, 0.1) to strike a balance between speed and accuracy.\n",
        "            * max_depth: We tested depths of 3, 5, and 7 to manage tree complexity. If the trees are too deep, we risk overfitting; if they’re too shallow, we might underfit the data.\n",

        "            * max_depth: This controls how deep the trees can grow. By tuning this parameter, we balance overfitting and underfitting.\n",
        "            * min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf: These control how the trees are built by adjusting the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node and to be a leaf. This helps improve generalization and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "    * Reason for Choosing These Hyperparameters:\n",
        "        * These parameters are commonly used to balance the flexibility and simplicity of the model. They help control overfitting, especially when using a high number of trees, by ensuring the trees don’t become too complex.\n",

        "    * Reason for Choosing These Hyperparameters:\n",
        "        * The alpha parameter is critical in Ridge regression for controlling regularization. A larger value penalizes large coefficients more heavily, preventing overfitting; a smaller avalue allows the model more flexibility to fit the data.\n",

Error “OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor” was displayed during the cleanup of the worker threads used for parallel processing in GridSearchCV.  The warnings are common when working with parallel computation frameworks and can be ignored in this context; the final model performance should remain unaffected."
